### Hi, it's me Marco (not Mario) 👋 (he/him)

Welcome on my github page !
Unfortunately you will not find a lot of things because most of my projects are private.

### About me 😳

I'm an entrepreneur and developper.

I was student 📚 at [42born2code](https://www.42.fr/) the enginering school created by Xavier Niel.

I work as a freelance developper, but most of the time I spend time on my personal projects, from creating innovative software to developing 🎮 video games.

I worked in domains like Banking 🏦  and Influence Marketing 🎯

### My languages, tools and environments :

- Javascript 
- NodeJS
- C# (csharp)

- Flutter 📱
- Unreal Engine 5 🎮
- Unity 5 🎮
- SQL 💽
- NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB, CockroachDB) 💽
- Memory database (Redis) 💽
- Message broker (RabbitMQ) ✉️
